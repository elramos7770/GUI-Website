Description of functionality that is properly working.

-letter tiles in the player’s “hand” are selected randomly from a data structure with the
proper distribution of the letters
-letter tiles can be dragged-and-dropped onto target Scrabble squares
-program identifies which letter tile is dropped onto which Scrabble square
-board includes bonus squares
-score is tallied correctly, including consideration of bonus square multipliers
-any number of words can be played until the player wishes to quit or depletes all tiles
-the board is cleared after each round so that a new word can be played
-after playing a word, only the number of letter tiles needed to bring the player’s “hand”
back to 7 tiles are selected. All tiles are placed on to the right side of the rack.
-score is kept for multiple words until the user restart a new Game
-Tiles can only be dragged from the “rack” to Scrabble board. If the user drop them
anywhere else, they will be bounced back to the “rack”.
-Once the tile is placed on the Scrabble board, it can not be moved.
-Except for the first letter, all sub-subsequent letters must be placed directly next to or
below another letter with no space. Else, they will bounce back to the “rack”.
-user can always restart the game.
