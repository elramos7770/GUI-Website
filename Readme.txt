The following site was used to gather a template for my webpage.
NOTE: any JS not from bootstrap is from this site
https://startbootstrap.com/themes/freelancer/
The following site was used as reference to create my Navbar, the current navbar is a mix between this navbar and the template navbar.
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/navbars/#


A summary of what has been changed will be addressed from top to bottom.
1. The navbar has been significantly improved, while the current nav bar does not have the flashy button gradient in HW2
It not has better functionality. Both navbars are fixed, however since HW2 was multiple pages scrolling was almost none existent
The switch to one page in HW4 allowed for better use of a fixed nav bar.

The navbar also now includes a dropdown menu for homeworks, allowing for an ease of transition, whereas in HW2 the homework link
led to a separate webpage which would contain links to the homework

2. The title banner now appropriately scales when going to mobile. Whereas in HW2 the banner would scale, however it would not be at the same ration as desktop.
The background is also now applied in a container allowing for a more clean feel than HW2.

3. The about me section is now smaller and more centered, leaving an open space feel to the site. The text is in a div that matches the size of a pfp next to it.
When scaled to mobile the text goes above the pfp rather than shrinking both like in HW2

4. The Social media section is the most improved by bootstrap. In HW2 the icons were scaled inline and aligned with flexbox. This allowed them to have an even amount of
space between them. However when the screen was shrunk to mobile, the icons would extend out of their container since they remained in a row of 4. With bootstrap when the
screen in shrunk the icons simply go into rows of 2, and then rows of 1. This maintains the icons in thier place.

5. The contact information is now in a row rather than a column list. This makes it take up significantly less space with the same amount of information.

Overall: Bootstrap allowed for better organization within the webpage. This allowed all the same information to be on one webpage without the page losing
quality in its appearance.
